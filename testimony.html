           <h1>Testimony</h1>
           <h3>After creating my own website, I learned that CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) plays a significant part in giving websites a gorgeous, 
            nice appearance, while on the other hand, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) merely serves as its framework of the web. I think that 
            these are a big part of the reason why some websites are quite boring because people tend to notice designs and styles first.
 
 
            It was first really confusing and took me a long time to finish the designs in order for them to all match and appear decent,
            including the background cover, font color, navigation color, and navigation color-hover. I struggled to fit everything, 
            making them stand out to easily get the interest of the audience or viewers of my web. However, after a while of trying 
            and discovering, I have realized that we should all refer to the color palette because color theory is a valuable tool 
            that shapes the perceptions of the users. It shows how designs and styles affect or influence users emotions, perceptions,
             and behavior.
             
            Overall, I find it both enjoyable and challenging because I realized that, in spite of my initial annoyance, I'm learning 
            and having fun at the same time. I really learned in this activity by keeping on experimenting things and changing the 
            style until it perfectly fit what I wanted, and with that, I discovered a lot of things, and I'm really glad that 
            it turns out really well for me. So, this challenge made me want to learn more about the styling of the elements
             in HTML to give life or colors to the structure I have created in HTML, because I really believe that styling
              not only enriches my technical skills but also fuels my creativity, making me excited to continue my journey 
              in learning the deeper context in designing a web page.
